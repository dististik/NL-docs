			<p>Threat Level: <span class="threat-ht">High Threat</span> (Primary)</p>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Lilligant at first glance does not seem like a very appealing pokemon given its typing of mono-Grass, fragile defenses, and mediocre speed. However, Lilligant has access to powerful tools in Chlorophyll and Quiver Dance (plus Sleep Powder). Lilligant synergizes fairly well with the two notable Sun Setters of Mega Charizard Y and Torkoal given how it can threaten Water-, Ground-, and Rock-types and in turn, the Setters can threaten the Steel- and Ice-types that can wall or threaten Lilligant’s sweep. Even outside of Sun, Lilligant can still leave an impact on the battle to a lesser extent having access to Sleep Powder and pressure the opponent to respond before you can Quiver Dance sweep. Where this mon lacks is in its defenses and inability to confidently fit Synthesis on sets where coverage is very important so it is prone to being worn down.

			<h3>Moves</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Quiver Dance allows Lilligant to maintain speed outside of Sun as well as improving its ability to punch through the opposing team</li>
				<li>Giga Drain is the main source of recovery as well as STAB though this can be forgone for Leaf Storm (Z-Leaf Storm to ignore drop for a turn) for more damage output</li>
				<li>Glaciate allows Lilligant to threaten the likes of Zygarde and Garchomp that normally check Mega Charizard Y but Power Gem is good because it can threaten the Flying- and Ice-types that may try to threaten Lilligant</li>
				<li>This slot is reserved for hitting the likes of Toxapex and Tran who wall both Mega Charizard Y and Lilligant normally or the likes of Celesteela and Ferrothorn who can normally wall Lilligant</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Items</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Life Orb is generally the best item for damage output but Grassium Z can be used if you’re opting for the powerful Leaf Storm option</li>
				<li>Focus Sash can be used to guarantee at least one Quiver Dance outside of Sun but is generally not necessary if you’re playing with Sun turns correctly</li>
				<li>Expert Belt is an alternative for Life Orb if recoil is not favorable though the damage drop is fairly noticeable</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>EV Spread</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Straightforward investment to maximize SpA and Spe (have to check speed benchmarks for them fast bois)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Teammates</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Mega Charizard Y</b>: Best Sun setter in the metagame and synergizes extremely well with Lilligant so there’s little reason to not run these two together</li>
				<li><b>Torkoal</b>: In the event that Mega Charizard Y does not fit onto the team or you prefer 8 turns of Sun, you can opt for Torkoal who covers Lilligant in a similar way but does pack way less of a punch</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Other Options</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Sleep Powder is an excellent option for Lilligant, especially if choosing to run Lilligant without the Sun. This will come at the cost of important coverage, putting more emphasis on your team to eliminate all that stands in front of Lilligant’s sweep</li>
				<li>Energy Ball is a powerful STAB though it generally is lackluster in comparison to Giga Drain and Leaf Storm</li>
				<li>Growth is a faster way to setup in the Sun but the lack of Spe boosts means that Lilligant has to get more done while Sun turns are active</li>
				<li>Nature Power is a cheeky move to use if paired with one or more of the Tapus as it offers excellent Terrain boosted coverage but this can be a very unreliable option</li>
				<li>Dream Eater offers strong Psychic coverage against Poison-types that threaten Lilligant but will require you to run Psychium Z or Sleep Powder</li>
			</ul>
